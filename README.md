## Tech Stack

- we are using Flask, Python Microframework for Web App Development
- we have used JavaScript Mainly to bring intractivity to the web page
- particularly we are using a JavaScript library D3.js (Data Driven Document) For Data Analysis
- For Plotting Maps We are using a JavaScript library topoJSON.js an extension to GeoJSON.js
- For Potting Maps and Charts we used Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) elements to give clear pictures even on Large Zooming
- other than JavaScript we are using technologies like HTML, CSS and BootStrap to bring some more intractive and responsive nature to the webapp
